# Rapidfire_NLP
According to The First 20 Hours, a book on skill aquisition, the best way to solidify a skill is to practice it in small-ish rapid fire sets as oppose to doing large singular projects.  The idea of this project is to obtain as much information via various website API's and to perform NLP on them all as an opportunity to practice these skills.
